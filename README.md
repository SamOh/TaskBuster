Welcome to TaskBuster's documentation!
======================================
Below I'll provide a quick overview of the project, its purpose, a list of some interesting tech I learned/used in the creation of this project, and some credits.


Project
-------
This project is a task manager created using Django. A user can create an account (through gmail google sign in), login, and then manage different to-do lists on their account.

Purpose
-------
The purpose of creating this project was mainly to get my hands dirty using new technologies and frameworks that I was otherwise unfamiliar with. Much of this project is directly an extension of Marina Mele's [django tutorial](http://www.marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial/taskbuster-working-environment-and-start-django-project). 

Tech
----
An incomplete list of some of the new tech I dealt with in the creation of this project is:
Django/python
PostgreSQL
Codeship
Heroku
Docker

Credits
-------
Huge credits go to Marina Mele for her [django tutorial](http://www.marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial/taskbuster-working-environment-and-start-django-project).
